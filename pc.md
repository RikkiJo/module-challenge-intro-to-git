## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
   Git allows us to store code on the cloud and to collaborate with other developers.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
   Git is the commands we send to the cloud, whereas GitHub is the digital folder in which we keep the code.

3. Why do we create a branch?
   To make it necessary for multiple people to make changes that will 
   potentially end up merging back onto the main branch.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
   Pull requests are how you send in your contribution to a project when you work with 
   other developers.
 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
   git checkout -b main

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
   'Git fetch' pulls from one or more repositories along with objects necessary to complete their histories. 'Git merge' will join two or more development histories together. 'Git pull' integrates with another repository or a local branch.

7. What is a merge conflict?
   This happens when git cannot automatically resolve code differences between two or more commits.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
   open the file and make the necessary changes.
